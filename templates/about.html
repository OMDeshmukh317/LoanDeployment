        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <p>
            This project is a machine learning-based classification system designed to predict loan status 
            (approved or rejected) based on various borrower characteristics. By analyzing key factors such as 
            income, credit history, and loan amount, the project provides insights into loan eligibility and 
            automates the decision-making process for financial institutions. The goal is to develop a robust 
            and efficient model that handles diverse data types while ensuring high predictive accuracy.
        </p>

        <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The dataset used for this project consists of 45,000 entries and 14 features, sourced from <strong>Kaggle</strong>. It includes a mix of 
            numerical and categorical variables, representing diverse borrower characteristics such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Demographics:</strong> Age, gender, and education level.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Details:</strong> Income, employment experience, and home ownership status.</li>
            <li><strong>Loan Features:</strong> Loan amount, interest rate, loan intent, and percentage of income dedicated to loans.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit History:</strong> Credit score, credit history length, and previous loan defaults.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The target variable, <strong>loan_status</strong>, indicates whether the loan was approved (1) or rejected (0).
        </p>

        <h2>Key Steps in Model Development</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> The dataset was pre-cleaned, eliminating the need for additional handling of missing values.</li>
            <li><strong>Outlier Detection:</strong> Identified and addressed to enhance model reliability.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Explored feature distributions and relationships using EDA techniques.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Encoding:</strong> Transformed categorical variables using Label Encoding for compatibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Class Imbalance Handling:</strong> Used SMOTE to address target variable imbalance.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Evaluated the following algorithms using cross-validation:
                <ul>
                    <li>Logistic Regression</li>
                    <li>Decision Tree Classifier</li>
                    <li>Random Forest Classifier</li>
                    <li>Gaussian Naive Bayes</li>
                    <li>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</li>
                    <li>AdaBoost</li>
                    <li>XGBoost</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Hyperparameter Tuning:</strong> Optimized models using GridSearchCV.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Results and Performance</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>XGBoost</strong> model emerged as the best performer, achieving an accuracy of <strong>93%</strong>. This demonstrates 
            the effectiveness of preprocessing and model selection.
        </p>

        <h2>Deployment</h2>
        <p>
            The final model was deployed using Django, creating a user-friendly web application. The system is hosted on <strong>Render</strong>, 
            making it accessible for real-world use.
        </p>
